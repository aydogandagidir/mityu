//! The copilot's Tauri command surface. Registered in `lib.rs`.
//!
//! TS bindings live in `frontend/src/services/copilotService.ts` — the only
//! place these names appear on the renderer side.
//!
//! ```ts
//! const status = await invoke<CopilotStatus>('copilot_get_status');
//! const status = await invoke<CopilotStatus>('copilot_set_config', { config });
//! await invoke('copilot_toggle_panel');
//! await invoke('copilot_close_panel');
//! await invoke('copilot_focus_main_window');
//! await invoke('copilot_request_insight', { action: 'recap' });
//! await invoke('copilot_cancel_insight');
//! ```
//!
//! Most commands here are local, synchronous work over a settings file and a
//! window handle: no network, no database, no model, no transcript.
//! [`copilot_request_insight`] is the exception and the reason this note is no
//! longer a blanket claim — it reads settings from SQLite and calls a model
//! (I3b). It stays thin in the same way `ask::commands` does: it resolves
//! identity, config and paths, then delegates to [`super::insight`], where
//! every rule is testable without a running app.
