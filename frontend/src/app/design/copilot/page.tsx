/**
 * `/design/copilot` — the copilot panel with fixture data (BACKLOG I1, I3b).
 *
 * The real panel (`/copilot`) renders nothing outside the Tauri shell: it waits
 * on `copilot_get_status` and on the `transcript-update` stream, neither of
 * which exists in a browser. That is exactly the trap `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`
 * describes — a screenshot of a page that "renders nothing" still produces a
 * valid PNG — so this route feeds the same component fixed props instead, which
 * is what `tools/ui/shoot.py` can actually verify.
 *
 * The states are side by side because the differences between them are the
 * product decisions worth reviewing: what the panel says when no recording is
 * running (it never records on its own), how honestly it states the
 * screen-sharing posture on a platform that enforces it versus one that cannot,
 * and what it says when the user has switched that request off — where the
 * platform's verdict must not be shown at all, because Mityu never asked.
 *
 * I3b adds the second row: the insight region in each of its phases. The three
 * worth looking hardest at are the refusals, because they are what the product
 * says when it has nothing — an empty card would read as "there is nothing in
 * this conversation", which the copilot has no basis for saying.
