# BACKLOG — Ordered, executable tasks

The agent works this list **top-to-bottom**, respecting `depends-on`. Each task: an ID, the owning agent, the slash command to use, concrete acceptance criteria, and its gate. "Done" also requires the CLAUDE.md Definition of Done. Do not reorder to chase easy wins; dependencies exist for correctness.

Legend: **Agent** = `.claude/agents/` file · **Cmd** = `.claude/commands/`.

## EPIC A — Foundation (Phase 0)

### A1 · Wire the pack & orient
- Agent: (orchestrator) · Cmd: — · depends-on: none
- AC: BOOTSTRAP Step 0 done; contradictions between docs and repo resolved via ADRs.

### A2 · Dev environment reproducible
- Agent: qa-release-engineer · Cmd: — · depends-on: A1
- AC: SETUP.md "environment ready" checklist passes on macOS and Windows (state which were verified); offline summary via Ollama works.

### A3 · Rebrand to Mityu
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: A2
- AC: productName/identifier/title, package.json, Cargo.toml → Mityu/com.bluedev.mityu/mityu; icons + strings replaced; MIT LICENSE intact; app launches branded.

### A4 · Lock ADR-0003/0004/0005
- Agent: sync-server-architect (0003), audio-pipeline-engineer (0004) · Cmd: — · depends-on: A2
- AC: server language chosen; authoritative audio module identified with evidence; retention default confirmed. All Accepted in DECISIONS.md.

### A5 · Phase 0 transcription validation ⏸ DEFERRED — not a v1.0.4 publication blocker
- Agent: audio-pipeline-engineer + qa-release-engineer · Cmd: /phase0-validate · depends-on: A2
- AC: PHASE0_VALIDATION.md report produced; WER + domain-vocab thresholds met; **human-reviewed go/no-go recorded**. If NO-GO → scope narrows to meeting-room; do not enter EPIC C field features.
- Current evidence (2026-07-15): Whisper `large-v3` and Parakeet v3 int8 are installed/integrity-verified and the harness fails closed correctly. The four consented real-audio buckets remain `0/5`; twenty 2–10 minute recordings, human-corrected references, diarization review and the human verdict are still required. This is NOT EVALUATED, not a measured quality NO-GO.
- v1.0.4 exception (ADR-0027): the product owner accepted this as explicit evidence debt for this patch only. A5 is neither PASS nor waived for field/accuracy claims; it must close before those claims or any downstream phase that depends on proven target-environment quality.
- **Execution runbook: `docs/A5_SPRINT.md`** (2026-07-26). Owner decisions locked there: the `jargon` bucket splits into 5 legal + 5 intralogistics clips (**25 recordings total**, not 20), and the §4 GO/NO-GO numbers are locked *before* measurement. Two pre-sprint code debts are recorded: the harness build recipe (vendored-OpenSSL/perl) and per-clip vocabulary selection — the global ~600-char vocab prompt would otherwise bias only whichever domain is listed first in the jargon file.

---

## EPIC B — Tenant-aware seams (Phase 1, still single-tenant/local)

### B1 · WorkspaceContext / AuthContext seam
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: A3
- AC: `AuthContext { tenant_id, user_id, roles, request_id }` exists (docs/CONTRACTS.md); in local mode resolves to a single local user/workspace; no code reads "current user" any other way.

### B2 · `workspace_id` on all entities + repository layer
- Agent: db-migration-engineer + rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /db-migration then /prep-multitenant · depends-on: B1
- AC: forward-only migration adds `workspace_id` (+ sync fields) to meetings/transcripts/chunks/summaries/action_items; a tenant-scoped Repository is the ONLY storage access path; migration applies on empty + populated DB.

### B3 · Encrypted local store (SQLCipher)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /feature then /security-review · depends-on: B2
- AC: sensitive local data encrypted at rest; key from OS-protected store; app still opens existing data (migration path documented).

### B4 · Dormant sync module skeleton
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /add-tauri-command · depends-on: B2
- AC: `sync/` client module with typed protocol messages (docs/CONTRACTS.md) but disabled; app fully works with it off.

---

## EPIC C — Core product value (Phase 1 MVP)

### C1 · Source-linked structured summaries + HITL
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: B2
- v1.0.4 sequencing exception (ADR-0027): source linkage and HITL are quality-independent safety controls and may ship while A5 remains NOT EVALUATED. This does not establish transcription accuracy.
- AC: summary uses the Block/Section schema; **every block/action item carries `source_chunk_id`**; UI renders drafts with Approve + visible source link; nothing publishes without approval.

### C2 · Action-item extraction
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: C1
- AC: action items (text, assignee?, due?, status, source_chunk_id) extracted as drafts; editable; approved items persisted.

### C3 · Search across meetings/transcripts
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: B2
- AC: superseded/strengthened by C3a for transcript evidence. Summary retrieval may index **only human-approved, source-linked** blocks in a later additive slice; legacy or unapproved summary text is prohibited from the trusted search surface.

### C3a · Ranked evidence search (Product Intelligence foundation)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature then /db-migration · depends-on: B2
- Owner-directed sequencing exception (2026-07-14, ADR-0024; narrowed for v1.0.4 by ADR-0027): transcription-quality-independent implementation may land while A5 and C8 remain deferred/not passed; no target-environment quality or pilot-value claim follows from it.
- AC: local FTS5/BM25 ranks transcript evidence without a network/LLM dependency; every result resolves to an active same-workspace `source_chunk_id`; query syntax is bounded/escaped and one-character prefix scans are rejected; UI preserves backend relevance order, debounces and rejects stale responses, and opens/highlights the source segment; raw corpus-dependent rank, query and snippet never enter analytics/logs. Legacy/unapproved summaries are excluded; approved-summary retrieval is a later additive slice.

### C3b · Approved Action Center (Product Intelligence slice 2)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: C2, B2
- Owner-directed sequencing exception (2026-07-14, ADR-0025; narrowed for v1.0.4 by ADR-0027): this read-only, quality-independent slice may land while A5 and C8 remain deferred/not passed; no target-environment quality or pilot-value claim follows from it.
- AC: generation cannot persist a non-draft review state; only active same-workspace `action_items.status = 'approved'` rows with an active same-meeting transcript source are returned; draft/edited/rejected, stale, soft-deleted and cross-tenant rows fail closed. The bounded API exposes visible pagination and source metadata; the `/actions` UI preserves backend order, shows AI-extracted/human-approved provenance and opens the exact transcript segment. V1 is offline/read-only and adds no work-progress state, overdue inference, analytics content or automatic external action.

### C4 · Export (PDF / DOCX / Markdown)
- Agent: frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: C1
- AC: a meeting's approved summary + action items export to PDF/DOCX/MD with source timestamps; works offline.

### C5 · Consent + transparency UI
- Agent: frontend-nextjs-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /feature then /security-review · depends-on: C1
- AC: visible "recording active" indicator; analytics opt-in; "AI-generated (review required)" labeling; these cannot be hidden. Backs EU AI Act Art. 50.

### C6 · Retention & redaction policy (local)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: B3
- AC: configurable retention (default: delete audio after transcription); basic PII/keyword redaction rules applied before persistence/summary.

### C6a · Verifiable local deletion semantics ✅ CLOSED for v1.0.4
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /security-review then /feature · depends-on: B3, C3a
- AC: an accepted ADR defines SQLite/FTS5 deletion semantics across FTS shadow tables, free pages and WAL; the implementation applies the chosen `secure_delete` + checkpoint/vacuum or crypto-erasure policy; an automated sentinel test verifies the documented guarantee after the maintenance cycle; SSD/filesystem limitations are disclosed in-product. This must pass before the C8 security sign-off—logical/index removal alone is insufficient for a forensic-erasure claim.
- Closure evidence (2026-07-14): ADR-0026 accepted; migration `20260714010000` persists FTS5 secure-delete and a content-free crash-resume marker; every SQLite connection enables core secure-delete; tenant-scoped deletion scrubs only canonical-root Mityu-managed artifacts without following symlinks, retains unknown user files, then requires FTS optimize + checked WAL truncate + `VACUUM` + zero free pages + final checkpoint before success. Startup resumes pending maintenance and browser recovery copies are logically purged. `secure_local_deletion.rs` uses a unique sentinel to verify database, FTS, WAL and app-managed artifacts, including a cross-tenant no-op. The product copy explicitly disclaims SSD/COW/snapshot/backup/export/WebView physical-erasure guarantees. A5 and C8 remain open roadmap gates but are deferred/non-blocking for v1.0.4 under ADR-0027; legal, signing and updater-canary gates remain unchanged. The Windows FFmpeg technical publication gate closed on 2026-07-15.

### C7 · Editor convergence to BlockNote
- Agent: frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /refactor via /feature · depends-on: C1
- AC: canonical editor = BlockNote; no new TipTap/Remirror usage; legacy paths inert.

### C9 · EU AI Act Art. 50(1) assessment for "Ask This Meeting" — ✅ DONE 2026-08-10 (ADR-0032 amendment)
- Agent: security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /security-review · depends-on: —
- AC: ADR-0032 states that the conversational Ask surface "would engage [Art. 50(1)] and must be assessed before it ships". The surface is on `main` (`SummaryPanel.tsx` mounts `AskPanel` whenever a transcript exists, with no flag) but is in **no released binary** — the newest tag anywhere is `v1.0.4`, which predates it. So the gate is **due, not breached**, and the cheap window closes at the next tag. Either record the assessment as an ADR-0032 amendment, or put the panel behind a default-off flag until it is done. — **Resolved by the first route, on the owner's instruction not to hide working features.** The assessment is recorded as an ADR-0032 amendment (2026-08-10). It found the panel already carried an Art. 50(**2**) content marking but only *implied* the Art. 50(**1**) interaction disclosure; the note now opens "You are asking an AI assistant". Present before interaction, non-dismissable, both obligations asserted separately, and confirmed load-bearing by three mutations. The panel ships enabled. Also carries ADR-0032's two counsel questions (does Art. 50(2) reach HITL summarisation; Art. 50(1) for the Ask surface).

### C10 · NPU enumeration + OS-native inference backends (ADR-0033)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: —
- AC: ADR-0033 landed the capability probe and a dormant seam, deliberately without faking the parts it could not implement: Windows/Linux NPU enumeration, the OS-native backend implementations themselves, and the wiring into provider assembly and the UI. `NpuVendor::Undetermined` must stay distinguishable from "none".

### C11 · Learning system (ADR-0030) — in-app live smoke test
- Agent: — (needs a running GUI + a live model) · Cmd: — · depends-on: —
- AC: the learning loop is built and unit-tested, but has never been exercised end-to-end through the app: CPU build, Ollama configured, "look for patterns" on, make ≥3 corrections and approve, and confirm a "Suggested by the model" Proposed rule appears. An agent cannot substitute for this; it needs the GUI and a model.

### C8 · Phase 1 exit ⏸ DEFERRED for v1.0.4 — still a downstream gate
- Agent: qa-release-engineer · Cmd: /release (dry-run) · depends-on: C1–C7 (including C6a)
- AC: app works fully offline; a real pilot user completes record→approve→export; DoD green; multitenancy-guardian + security-privacy-auditor pass.
- Evidence protocol: `docs/PILOT_V1.0.4.md` is ready, but no human pilot has been performed. ADR-0027 makes C8 non-blocking only for publication of v1.0.4; it is not PASS, unlocks none of EPIC D/F/G, and still requires a real user to execute and sign the protocol against an immutable candidate after A5. An AI agent cannot substitute for the pilot user or approve the generated content.

---

## EPIC D — Optional server (Phase 2, only after C8 + a team-customer need)

### D1 · Server skeleton (NEW, clean) — auth + tenancy from commit #1
- Agent: sync-server-architect · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: A4(0003), C8
- AC: `server/` per ADR-0003; OIDC authn; AuthContext derived per request; Postgres + RLS; health/version; NOT the legacy backend.

### D2 · Tenant model + RBAC + audit
- Agent: sync-server-architect + db-migration-engineer · Cmd: /db-migration then /tenant-check · depends-on: D1
- AC: tenants/users/memberships; roles owner/admin/member/viewer enforced on every sensitive route; append-only audit log; **negative cross-tenant test passes**.

### D3 · Tenant-scoped sync API + enable client sync
- Agent: sync-server-architect + rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature then /tenant-check · depends-on: D2, B4
- AC: sync protocol (rev/updated_by/soft-delete, LWW + audit on conflict); client SQLite ↔ server Postgres; app still works with server DOWN.

### D4 · Team features (shared workspaces, admin console, SSO)
- Agent: sync-server-architect + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: D3
- AC: share a meeting to a workspace; admin console scoped to one tenant; enterprise SSO via OIDC.

### D5 · Phase 2 exit ⛔ GATE
- Agent: qa-release-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /release · depends-on: D1–D4
- AC: cross-tenant isolation verified; app runs with server down; /security-review clean; first team/enterprise customer live.

---

## EPIC E — Managed SaaS (Phase 3, only after D5 + unit-economics validation)
- E1 per-tenant metering + billing · E2 hosted IdP + EU-region deploy · E3 isolation/scale hardening · E4 self-serve onboarding.
- GATE E5: unit economics positive; isolation & audit verified at scale.

---

## EPIC F — On-device AI agents (Phase 1+, optional; only after gate C8)

Backs the About "Coming soon: a library of on-device AI agents." Local-first, **draft-only (HITL)**, source-linked, tenant-scoped, **no autonomous external actions** (ADR-0013). A dormant seam already exists (`frontend/src-tauri/src/agents/`, off by default); these tasks turn it on in sequence. Meeting-platform (Zoom/Meet/Teams) *API* integration is intentionally **not** here — the app captures system audio and is not a meeting bot by default; opt-in integrations live in EPIC G (ADR-0018).

### F0 · ADR + agent boundaries ⛔ DESIGN GATE
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: — · depends-on: C8
- AC: ADR-0013 confirmed at kickoff — agents local-first, draft-only (HITL), source-linked, tenant-scoped, no autonomous external actions; trigger = manual/on-demand first. Dormant `agents/` seam already merged; this formalizes scope before code.

### F1 · Agent framework (flag-gated, wired) + `agent_runs` store
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + db-migration-engineer · Cmd: /add-tauri-command then /db-migration · depends-on: F0
- AC: `AgentRunner` reachable via a flag-gated Tauri command; forward-only migration adds `agent_runs` (`workspace_id` + sync fields) via the tenant-scoped Repository; providers reuse the `summary/` provider layer; app works with agents OFF (default) and fully offline.

### F2 · Follow-up drafter agent
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: F1, C1, C2
- AC: from an **approved** summary + action items, drafts a follow-up message as a DRAFT in the editor; user edits/approves; "send" is manual export/copy (**never** auto-send); every draft carries `source_chunk_id` links.

### F3 · Action-item tracker agent
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: F2
- AC: aggregates open action items across meetings into a review list (status, due, source); no auto-notifications; tenant-scoped by construction.

### F4 · Agents panel (UI + transparency)
- Agent: frontend-nextjs-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /feature then /security-review · depends-on: F2
- AC: run-on-demand, draft review/approve, per-run audit; "AI-generated · review required" labels (EU AI Act Art. 50); these cannot be hidden.

### F5 · Opt-in scheduling / automation ⛔ GATE
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /feature then /security-review · depends-on: F4
- AC: optional scheduled runs; even then outputs are draft-by-default or require explicit per-action approval; fully offline; `/security-review` + multitenancy-guardian pass; **no autonomous irreversible action ships**.

---

## EPIC G — Opt-in Integrations (ADR-0018; the core stays connectionless)

The app ships deliberately unconnected; an Integrations section lets the user consciously enable each connection after reading its terms. Everything here is OFF by default, per-workspace, and the app must remain fully functional (manual mode) with all of it off.

### G1 · Integrations hub UI + consent framework
- Agent: frontend-nextjs-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /feature then /security-review · depends-on: C8
- AC: an Integrations section lists available integrations, each OFF by default; enabling shows that integration's scope/consent text which the user must explicitly accept (acceptance recorded per-workspace with timestamp); disconnect wipes local tokens/state; with everything off the app behaves exactly as before.

### G2 · Calendar metadata (Google Calendar / Microsoft 365, read-only)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: G1
- AC: opt-in read-only calendar connection enriches meetings on-device (title/time/attendees; optional "meeting starting — record?" prompt); OAuth tokens in the OS keychain (ADR-0011 pattern); nothing transits bluedev infrastructure; offline or not-consented → manual naming unchanged; privacy policy gains an Integrations section.

### G3 · Meeting bot (Zoom/Teams/Meet auto-join) ⛔ needs its own ADR before code
- Agent: sync-server-architect + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: — (design first) · depends-on: G1, D5
- AC (frame only, per ADR-0018 Tier 2): bot joins only meetings the user connected and consented to; announces itself in-call; media path, processor role (DPA), retention and EU residency (E2) documented; per-integration kill switch; a detailed ADR + /security-review precede any implementation.

## EPIC H — Speaker diarization (ADR-0034 + ADR-0035)

> Ordering is not cosmetic here: H1 gates everything because a licence failure would throw away H3–H6 with no partial credit (ADR-0034 bans diarization-quality claims until A5's `multi` bucket exists, so there is nothing to bank early). H2 gates H3 *mechanically* — the moment `diarize-helper` is a workspace member, `ci.yml`'s `cargo test --all` on `ubuntu-latest` performs an unverified native download on every PR.

### H1 · Embedding + segmentation model licence verification ⛔ GATE — DONE 2026-08-09
- Agent: — · Cmd: — · depends-on: —
- AC: **met.** All three verified from primary sources and recorded in the ADR-0034 amendment (2026-08-09): pyannote segmentation-3.0 = MIT with the CNRS copyright, read from the `LICENSE` **inside** the sherpa tarball; CAM++ = Apache-2.0 from ModelScope's API and the 3D-Speaker repo LICENSE; TitaNet = CC-BY-4.0 from the HuggingFace API, not gated. Redistribution through sherpa's release assets preserves the required notices — verified by unpacking the artifact, not by argument.

### H2 · sherpa-onnx archive integrity bootstrap ⛔ PREREQUISITE FOR WORKSPACE MEMBERSHIP — DONE 2026-08-09
- Agent: qa-release-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: H1
- AC: **met.** `tools/diarization/fetch-sherpa-archive.py` fetches the archive from a pinned release tag and URL and verifies **exact byte length and SHA-256** for all five static targets (Windows x64, Linux x64/aarch64, macOS x64/arm64), re-verifying on every run rather than trusting the cache. It fails closed on a wrong digest, a wrong size, a malformed pin, and — unlike `build/ffmpeg.rs`, deliberately — on an **unpinned target**, because a warning there would restore the unverified download it exists to prevent. The `ci.yml` step is self-activating: a no-op until `Cargo.lock` contains `sherpa-onnx-sys`, so it costs nothing today and cannot be forgotten in the PR that adds `diarize-helper`.
- Proven end-to-end, with a control: with the verified directory supplied and `sherpa-onnx-sys` cleaned, the build completes and **never prints its download line**; from the *same* clean state with an empty directory it **fails** with `SHERPA_ONNX_ARCHIVE_DIR does not contain expected archive` — which is what proves the build script really re-ran, really consults the variable, and does not fall back to downloading.

### H3a · `diarize-helper` binary (ADR-0034 step c, engine half) — DONE 2026-08-09
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: H2
- AC: **met.** New workspace member on sherpa-onnx default (`static`) features. Audio in, anonymous turns out; no state, no database, no network. Emits JSON in exactly the `speaker_turns` shape *or* RTTM, so its output is scoreable by `eval-harness der` with no conversion step in between that could itself be wrong. Refuses a non-16 kHz or non-mono WAV rather than resampling or downmixing silently — a hidden conversion there would move every timestamp. `num_clusters` defaults to `-1` (unknown, cluster by threshold), so no speaker count is imposed on a two-person meeting.
- Proven on real audio: 16 s, two-speaker English sample with the real pyannote segmentation and CAM++ embedding models → **found exactly 2 speakers**, 4 turns, correct units and 1-based labels; its RTTM output re-scores 0.00% through `eval-harness der`. Fail-closed paths exercised: missing model, 8 kHz audio, stereo audio — all exit 1.
- `externalBin` is deliberately **not** added here: `tauri-build` fails when a listed sidecar binary is absent, so declaring it before anything invokes it would break every developer build for no benefit. That belongs with H3b.

### H3b-1 · Model manifest, verification and acquisition — DONE 2026-08-09
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: H3a
- AC: **met.** `src/diarization/models.rs` pins both artifacts by exact byte length and SHA-256 and verifies through `utils::verify_file_integrity` — the Parakeet shape, including its rule that an artifact **absent from the manifest is an error**. The segmentation archive's contents carry their own pins, because verifying the download says nothing about what is on disk a month later, and `status()` re-verifies on every call: a wrong model does not crash, it produces plausible and wrong speakers. The upstream MIT licence (`Copyright (c) 2022 CNRS`) is extracted and kept beside the model, since MIT requires the notice to travel with the copy. `tar` + `bzip2` add **no crate to the graph** — `sherpa-onnx-sys` already puts both in the lock file.
- Proven end to end: the real 6,958,444 B archive and 28,281,138 B embedding download, verify, extract; a second call is a no-op rather than a re-download; the extracted licence still carries the CNRS line. And the digests the manifest pins are **byte-identical** to the model files the helper demonstrably found 2 speakers with — so the manifest describes the artifacts that actually work, not merely artifacts that hash consistently. The network-dependent half is `#[ignore]`d so the suite does not fail for reasons unrelated to the code.

### H3b-2 · Wire the helper into the app — DONE 2026-08-09
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /add-tauri-command · depends-on: H3b-1
- AC: **met.** `externalBin` declared plus build steps in `ci.yml` and both `build.yml` platform paths (each running the archive bootstrap first). Four Tauri commands; availability is a four-state answer (`NoAudio` / `ModelsMissing` / `Ready` / `Done`) because collapsing any two makes the UI lie — in particular an empty result is an ANSWER and never-run is an OFFER, which only `diarized_at` separates. Availability uses `find_audio_file` itself, now `pub(crate)`, rather than a second copy that would eventually disagree with retranscription. Audio is decoded by the app's own decoder (already 16 kHz mono with a sinc resampler) rather than an FFmpeg subprocess — the helper refuses to resample, so the conversion has to be right, and this is the path retranscription already proves.
- Verified end to end with real models, the real sidecar and a real two-speaker recording: `ModelsMissing` → acquire → `Ready` → diarize → **4 turns, Speaker 1 + Speaker 2, stored** → `Done`. Plus 6 repository tests (tenant scoping in both directions, replace-not-append, empty pass still stamps, a refused write leaves prior turns intact) and 5 sidecar wire-contract tests.
- **Not exercised here:** `build.yml` runs only on dispatch/release, so its two new steps are unverified until a release. `ci.yml`'s step is exercised by this PR. A CONTROL was run for `externalBin`: with it declared and the binary absent, `tauri-build` fails with `resource path binaries\diarize-helper-… doesn't exist` — which is what makes those build steps mandatory rather than optional.
- No UI: speaker labels and talk-time are H6.

### H4 · Cross-platform CI for `diarize-helper`
- Agent: qa-release-engineer · Cmd: /release · depends-on: H3a
- AC: the helper is built on `windows-latest` and on macOS. Note the current gap: `ci.yml` builds and tests **only `ubuntu-latest`**, `release.yml` is Windows-only, and `build-macos.yml` is dispatch-only — so today a macOS break surfaces at release and a Windows break surfaces only in the release job.
- **Also fix, found 2026-08-09:** `build.yml`'s **llama-helper** macOS/Linux step builds for the runner host and copies the result under `inputs.target`'s name. On an Intel runner asked for `aarch64-apple-darwin` that puts an x86_64 binary inside an ARM app under an ARM filename — it looks right and fails to launch. The diarize-helper step was written from that same template and has been corrected to build with `--target`; llama-helper's has not, and is left as its own change because the macOS release path cannot be exercised from here.

### H5 · Diarization runtime + memory on a 60–90 minute recording — ✅ MEASURED 2026-08-10 (60 min)
- Agent: qa-release-engineer · Cmd: /audio-debug · depends-on: H3a
- AC: wall-clock and peak RSS measured on a long recording; decides whether H3 needs chunked progress reporting or can stay fire-and-forget. Clustering is superlinear in segment count, so a short-clip measurement does not answer this.

**Measured on Windows x64, release build, a 60.1-minute 16 kHz mono recording:**

| | |
|---|---|
| wall time | **14 min 27 s** (~4x faster than real time) |
| peak working set | **600 MB** |
| turns produced | 1491, none malformed, covering 0.3 s to 60.0 min |
| speech detected | 40.0 min of the 60.1 min file |

**And measured at 90 minutes too, rather than extrapolated:**

| | 60.1 min | 90.1 min | ratio (audio is 1.5x) |
|---|---|---|---|
| wall time | 14 min 27 s | **21 min 21 s** | 1.48x |
| peak working set | 600 MB | **1033 MB** | **1.72x** |
| turns | 1491 | 1932 | 1.30x |
| malformed turns | 0 | 0 | |

Two things this settles, and one of them is not what the acceptance criterion assumed:

- **Runtime is roughly linear in this range**, not superlinear -- 1.48x the time for 1.5x the audio. A 90-minute meeting takes about 21 minutes.
- **Memory is the part that grows faster than the input**: 1.72x for 1.5x the audio, crossing **1 GB** at 90 minutes. That, not runtime, is the ceiling worth watching, and it is why the 2-hour case must be measured before anyone claims it works rather than extrapolated from these two points.

**A third observation that reinforces ADR-0034's ban on accuracy claims:** the 60-minute file produced **four** speakers and the 90-minute file, built from the same two voices by the same method, produced the correct **two**. Same material, same pipeline, different answer. Whatever that instability is, it is exactly why speaker accuracy may not be claimed until the A5 `multi` bucket exists (H9).

**It answers ADR-0035's open question: yes, the pass needs progress reporting.** Fourteen minutes behind an "Analysing…" label with no percentage, no elapsed time and no cancel reads as a hung app. That is a UX gap, not a correctness one — filed as H12.

**Observed, and deliberately NOT reported as an accuracy result:** the test file alternates two voices and the pass reported **four** speakers — 18.9 / 16.1 / 4.8 / 0.3 minutes, so two spurious clusters holding ~13% of the speech. The material is not representative: the "second voice" is the same recording resampled to a higher pitch, which also speeds it up and adds artifacts, so it is not two humans. ADR-0034 forbids accuracy claims until the A5 `multi` bucket exists, and this measurement does not change that — it is a runtime and memory result only. It does suggest the `multi` bucket (H9) matters more than a nice-to-have.

**A methodology note worth keeping.** The first harness reported the helper "hung" for 70 minutes. It had not: the harness redirected stdout to a PIPE and only read it after the process exited, so the child blocked writing 187 KB of JSON into a full kernel buffer while the parent waited for an exit that could not come. The app is unaffected — `sidecar.rs` uses tokio's `Command::output()`, which drains both pipes concurrently. Any future harness must redirect to a file or drain concurrently, or it will measure its own deadlock.

### H6 · Speaker labels + talk-time UI (ADR-0034 step d) — ✅ DONE (ADR-0036)
- Agent: frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: H3b-2
- AC: a transcript row overlapping more than one turn shows more than one speaker (rows and turns do not align — see the migration's own note); talk-time is descriptive only, never a score or ranking; labels stay anonymous `Speaker N` and naming a speaker is a manual human action; the four states are distinguished — no audio / never ran / ran-inconclusive / has turns.

### H10 · GPL-3.0 espeak-ng in `diarize-helper` — ✅ FIXED 2026-08-10 (pin swap + vendored crate patch)
- Agent: qa-release-engineer · Cmd: /security-review · blocks: H7 (sherpa half), and shipping diarization at all
- **Measured, not argued.** `sherpa-onnx-sys` 1.13.4's static link list names `espeak-ng` and `piper_phonemize` (`build.rs:23-24`), and the pinned prebuilt archive carries `lib/espeak-ng.lib`. The **release** binary (`cargo build -p diarize-helper --release`, 18,465,280 B) contains **51 espeak function symbols** (`espeak_Initialize`, `espeak_CompileDictionary`, …), 3 espeak runtime error strings and 2 espeak Windows registry keys. `/OPT:REF` does **not** discard it — this was checked precisely because it discarded all of sherpa in the earlier link spike.
- **eSpeak NG is GPL-3.0** — verified from its own `COPYING` ("GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007"). Shipping this binary inside a closed commercial installer distributes GPL-3.0 object code without GPL terms or corresponding source.
- **The clean fix exists upstream:** sherpa-onnx gates both libraries behind one CMake option — `option(SHERPA_ONNX_ENABLE_TTS "Whether to build TTS related code" ON)`; espeak-ng and piper-phonemize are pulled in only inside `if(SHERPA_ONNX_ENABLE_TTS)`. Diarization needs neither.
- **But the crate cannot reach it:** `sherpa-onnx-sys` is prebuilt-only (`download_prebuilt_libs`, `SHERPA_ONNX_ARCHIVE_DIR`); it has no CMake path, so there is nowhere to pass `TTS=OFF`. Fixing this therefore needs BOTH a TTS-off archive AND a link list that omits `espeak-ng`/`piper_phonemize`.
- **Checked, and it is far smaller than first recorded: k2-fsa already publishes `no-tts` prebuilts.** Queried the v1.13.4 release (303 assets). A `-no-tts-lib` twin exists for every target we pin except one:

  | pinned target | current asset | `no-tts` twin |
  |---|---|---|
  | `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` | `win-x64-static-MT-Release-lib` (119,847,445 B) | **yes** — `...-no-tts-lib` (116,684,776 B) |
  | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `linux-x64-static-lib` | **yes** (21,142,120 B) |
  | `x86_64-apple-darwin` | `osx-x64-static-lib` | **yes** (18,236,816 B) |
  | `aarch64-apple-darwin` | `osx-arm64-static-lib` | **yes** (18,353,357 B) |
  | `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` | `linux-aarch64-static-lib` | **NO — upstream publishes none** |

  So the fix is a **pin swap plus a ~6-line crate patch**, not a from-source build, and ADR-0035's "pinned upstream immutable release" story survives intact. Two hardcoded things in `sherpa-onnx-sys` must change: `archive_name()` builds the TTS-on filename with no switch, and `STATIC_LIBS` names `piper_phonemize`, `espeak-ng` and `ucd`. Vendor a patched copy, or upstream a `no-tts` cargo feature.
- **The one gap is `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`**, for which upstream publishes no `no-tts` build at all. That target is pinned by `fetch-sherpa-archive.py` but is built by neither `ci.yml` nor `build.yml`, and ADR-0022 already records Linux system audio as broken — so the honest choices are to drop the pin (the bootstrap already fails closed on unpinned targets) or build that one target from source. Decide it explicitly rather than letting it ship TTS-on.
- If the above is rejected: build every target from source with `SHERPA_ONNX_ENABLE_TTS=OFF` (H2's `SHERPA_ONNX_ARCHIVE_DIR` indirection makes this mechanically easy, but the pin then covers *our* artifact and H2's integrity story needs rewriting), or move to a different engine. **Owner decision — it touches ADR-0035.**
- AC: the shipped `diarize-helper` binary contains zero espeak/piper symbols, proven the same way this was found (`strings` over the release binary), with that check wired into CI so it cannot regress. — **MET.** Release binary went 18,465,280 → 17,737,216 B; espeak symbols 51 → **0**, espeak runtime markers 3 → **0**, registry keys 2 → **0**, piper **0**. The 12 remaining case-insensitive "espeak" hits are all the word *Speaker* (`OfflineSpeakerDiarization`, `wespeaker`) — which is why `tools/diarization/check-no-gpl-espeak.py` matches anchored symbols and espeak's own runtime strings instead of a naive substring; a check that cries wolf on a clean binary gets switched off.
- **How it was done:** `vendor/sherpa-onnx-sys/` (22 files, upstream 1.13.4 with two declarations changed) wired via `[patch.crates-io]`, pins in `fetch-sherpa-archive.py` swapped to the `-no-tts` archives, and `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` dropped — the vendored `archive_name()` returns an explicit error for it rather than silently falling back to a TTS-on build. The link list was not guessed: it is exactly the 11 `.lib` files present in the no-tts archive.
- **Verified beyond linking.** `--help` proves only the CLI, which is the same false pass ADR-0035 records from the first link spike. Pointed at existing-but-invalid model files, the helper aborts with `Rust cannot catch foreign exceptions` — a C++ exception thrown from inside sherpa/ONNX Runtime, which is proof the native library is live and executing rather than discarded.
- **Guard wired into all three places that build the sidecar:** `ci.yml`, and both the Windows and macOS/Linux steps of `build.yml` — the latter matter most, since that workflow produces the installer, and the check runs BEFORE the binary is copied into the bundle. Each run does `--self-test` first, because a detector nobody has seen fail is indistinguishable from one that cannot fail. Controls: the old TTS-on binary fails it with 50 symbols and 8 markers; the new one passes.

### H7 · Third-party notices for the sidecar and models — ✅ DONE 2026-08-10
- Agent: qa-release-engineer · Cmd: /release · depends-on: H3b-2
- AC: `resources/MODEL-NOTICES.txt` gains the MIT text + `Copyright (c) 2022 CNRS` for segmentation and the Apache-2.0 attribution for CAM++ (published as a bare `.onnx` with no licence file, so the notice is ours to supply) — **DONE 2026-08-10**, guarded by `models::tests::every_downloaded_model_is_attributed_in_the_notice_file`, which fails if a pin is added without a notice. The sidecar half was **BLOCKED on H10** — the binary was not purely Apache-2.0, it also carried GPL-3.0 espeak-ng, so an Apache-2.0 notice would have been a false notice. H10 removed the espeak, and the notice is now written: `resources/SIDECAR-NOTICES.txt` plus the full `resources/COPYING.Apache-2.0.txt`, both bundled.
- **Every linked component's licence was verified from its own upstream repository, not assumed:** sherpa-onnx, kaldi-decoder, kaldifst, OpenFST (v1.8.5 fork), kaldi-native-fbank and simple-sentencepiece are Apache-2.0; ONNX Runtime is MIT; KISS FFT is BSD-3-Clause (SPDX identifier read from its own `COPYING`). GitHub classified kaldifst, kissfft and openfst as `NOASSERTION`, so those three were resolved by reading their licence files directly. All permissive; no GPL.
- The prebuilt archive ships **no licence files of its own** (only `lib/*.lib`), so the notices are Mityu's to supply — the same situation as CAM++.
- **The notice quotes the archive's SHA-256, not the helper binary's.** Mityu compiles the helper per release so its hash moves between builds; quoting one would be false in the shipped installer the moment it was written.
- Guarded by four tests in `diarization::sidecar::notice`, each confirmed load-bearing by mutation: bumping the pin while leaving the notice stale, writing the notice without bundling it, dropping a component from the list, and deleting the `no-tts` justification while leaving the no-GPL claim standing — all four fail the suite.

### H11 · `diarize-helper` aborts instead of erroring on an unreadable model
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /fix-bug · found while verifying H10
- Pointed at a file that exists but is not a valid ONNX model, the helper dies with `fatal runtime error: Rust cannot catch foreign exceptions, aborting` — a C++ exception from sherpa crossing the FFI boundary with no catch. Low severity in practice: models are SHA-256 verified before use (H3b-1), and the sidecar is a separate process so it cannot take the app down (ADR-0035). But the app sees a crash rather than a message, so the user is told nothing useful.
- AC: an unreadable model produces a clear error on stderr and a non-zero exit, not an abort.

### H12 · A diarization pass needs progress reporting
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature · found by H5
- H5 measured 14.5 minutes for a 60-minute recording. The UI shows "Analysing…" on a disabled button for that whole time — no percentage, no elapsed time, no cancel. That reads as a hung app, and a user will kill it.
- ADR-0035 flagged exactly this as the thing the measurement would decide: "this determines whether the sidecar needs chunked progress reporting." It does.
- AC: the pass reports progress the UI can show, and can be cancelled; a long pass never looks indistinguishable from a hang.

### H13 · Make `TranscriptUpdate.source` real (microphone vs system) — `audio/`, §4 smoke required
- Agent: audio-pipeline-engineer · Cmd: /audio-debug then /feature · depends-on: — · found by I2 (ADR-0039)
- Today `audio/transcription/worker.rs` emits `source: "Audio"` for every segment, so nothing downstream can tell the user's microphone from system audio. The copilot (`copilot::session::Channel`) and the panel are written against the future values `microphone`/`system` and need no change when this lands; the A5 `multi` bucket and any speaker-side feature depend on it.
- AC: each `TranscriptUpdate` carries the capture channel of the chunk it came from (`microphone` | `system`), decided at capture/mix time where the two streams are still separate — never inferred from the audio; the mixed-stream case (one chunk containing both) is named explicitly rather than guessed; existing consumers (`TranscriptContext.tsx`, `recording_saver`) keep working unchanged; the field's semantics are documented at the struct. This is a CLAUDE.md §4 change: no other subsystem is touched in the same PR, and the manual record → transcript smoke runs on at least one macOS and one Windows machine before merge.
- Verification: a unit test at the point of attribution; the §4 smoke recorded in the PR; `copilot::session::tests::the_producer_does_not_attribute_a_channel_today` is **flipped**, not deleted, when this lands.

### H8 · DER instrument hardening
- Agent: qa-release-engineer · Cmd: /fix-bug · depends-on: —
- AC: `parse_rttm`/`parse_uem` strip a UTF-8 BOM (today a BOM silently drops the first `SPEAKER` record — and `Set-Content -Encoding utf8`, which the harness's own error message recommends, writes one); `secs_to_micros` range-checks instead of saturating; a negative `tbeg` is rejected. Cross-check: assert each perturbation actually changed the turn list (22 of 216 files are single-speaker, so `merge` currently self-scores), default `--tolerance` to 0, and extend md-eval coverage to `der-suite` pooling, `--skip-overlap` and `--uem`, none of which has ever been put in front of md-eval. Add a `--limit N` cross-check CI job or a committed expected-DER fixture — today, reverting either convention bug caught in PR #20 leaves `cargo test` fully green.

### H9 · A5 `multi` bucket: decide whether a speaker-labelled reference is produced
- Agent: — (owner decision) · Cmd: /phase0-validate · depends-on: —
- AC: `eval/raw/multi/` holds zero clips and `A5_SPRINT.md` instructs annotators **not** to write speaker labels or timestamps, so filling the bucket as specified can never yield a DER. Either the A5 protocol gains an RTTM reference for the `multi` clips, or ADR-0034's ban on speaker-accuracy claims becomes permanent rather than temporary. Until this is decided, H3–H6 ship best-effort with no accuracy claim.

## EPIC I — Live Copilot (in-meeting assistance, consent-grade — ADR-0038)

> Closes the one category gap the competitor analysis found (`docs/COMPETITIVE_CLUELY_GAP.md`): Mityu helps **after** a meeting; the live-assistant category (Cluely and its open-source clones) helps **during** it. This epic adds a private, always-on-top copilot panel, deterministic live context, on-demand grounded insights, meeting modes, a local knowledge base, on-demand screen context and post-call parity — **without** the category's deception features. Four invariants, enforced structurally and re-checked at I9:
> 1. **Private, not covert.** The panel is content-protected for *privacy* (honestly labelled per platform — see §4.3 of the analysis: Windows works, macOS 15+ is best-effort, Linux has no equivalent); the app never hides itself (no taskbar/dock hiding, no process renaming, no keyboard hooks); the word "undetectable" never appears in product or marketing.
> 2. **The copilot never captures on its own.** It consumes only the `transcript-update` stream of a recording session whose consent ticket was consumed (`recording_consent.rs`). `audio/` is not touched by any task in this epic (CLAUDE.md §4).
> 3. **Every insight is an AI-labelled, source-linked, non-persisted draft.** Art. 50(1) disclosure on first open + non-dismissable Art. 50(2) marking on every card (ADR-0032 pattern); `ask::grounding` rules apply (an out-of-window citation is dropped, never repaired); the only persistence is "Pin to notes", which writes a **draft** block with `source_chunk_id` into `summaries.sections`. No external action of any kind.
> 4. **Flag-gated, default OFF.** Mechanics may land before A5/C8 (the C1/C3a precedent, ADR-0019/0024); `liveCopilot` may default ON, and any live-help claim may be made, only after **A5 GO + the I9 gate**.
>
> Explicitly rejected (see the analysis §6/§11, ADR-0038): stealth/undetectability, candidate-side interview/exam/coding-solver modes, continuous screen recording, web profiling of third parties, web fact-checking by default, coaching/emotion scores, autonomous send/CRM writes, and any code from Natively (personal-use licence) or GPL clones.

### I0 · ADR-0038 + copilot boundaries ⛔ DESIGN GATE — ✅ DONE 2026-09-11
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: — · depends-on: —
- AC: **met by ADR-0038** — the four invariants above and the reject list are recorded before any code; module layout fixed (`copilot/`, `knowledge/`, `modes/`, `screen/`, `usage/`), no copilot table (insights are not persisted), and the enablement rule (A5 GO + I9) written down.

### I1 · Copilot window shell + global shortcuts (no AI yet)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /add-tauri-command then /feature · depends-on: I0
- AC: a second `WebviewWindow` labelled `copilot` loads the static-export route `/copilot`; always-on-top, undecorated, compact, resizable; position/size persisted via `tauri-plugin-store`; `set_content_protected` follows the workspace policy (default ON) and the panel shows an honest per-platform indicator — Windows "hidden from screen share (Windows 10 2004+)", macOS "best-effort: macOS 15+ ScreenCaptureKit may still capture this panel", Linux "not supported"; the app stays in the dock/taskbar (no `skip_taskbar` hiding, no process renaming); `tauri-plugin-global-shortcut` (MIT/Apache) added with user-editable keybinds (toggle panel · ask · capture screen) plus a "disable all shortcuts" switch; the panel shows the live transcript tail (last ~5 final segments) with **me/them** attribution taken from `TranscriptUpdate.source` (`microphone`/`system`), never from voice; recording state and pause/stop controls mirror the tray; the panel carries content only while a consented recording session is active; the copilot window is listed in the capability set with the minimum permissions; `liveCopilot` beta flag default OFF and, with it off, no shortcut is registered and no window is created (byte-identical behaviour, the `sync/`/`agents/` precedent). macOS non-activating panel via `tauri-nspanel` is optional here and may follow in a later slice. If Windows transparency misbehaves (tauri#8308) the panel falls back to opaque.
- Verification: Rust unit tests for the content-protection decision matrix per OS; keybind parser/validator tests; `app/design/copilot` fixture screenshot via `tools/ui/shoot.py`; manual Windows + macOS screen-share screenshots recorded in the PR.
- **Correction (I2, ADR-0039):** the me/them clause above assumed `TranscriptUpdate.source` names a device; the producer sets it to `"Audio"` for everything, so the panel shows the tail **unattributed**. I1 also filtered `is_partial` segments out of the tail — that flag means "under 15 s", not "about to be replaced", and the filter hid most speech; removed in I2.

### I2 · Live context service (deterministic, offline) — ✅ BUILT 2026-09-13 (`feat/i2-live-context`; PR pending)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: I1
- AC **as built** — two clauses of the original AC ("turns are attributed me/them from `source`"; "partials never enter the durable buffer, a final replaces its partial") were written against a producer that does not behave that way and are corrected here; the record of why is **ADR-0039**: `copilot::session` subscribes to `transcript-update` with `app.listen` (the `audio/recording_commands.rs:323` pattern) and keeps a bounded rolling window (default 180 s, configurable 30–900 via `liveWindowSecs` — a **view used to build a prompt, not a retention bound**; an out-of-range value is refused only when the caller changed it, and repaired otherwise, because no UI exposes the field and refusing it locked the user out of every save including switching the copilot off) plus a durable per-session buffer (memory only; capped at 20 000 segments with the eviction count reported; rebuilt at `recording-started` — where the tenant is re-resolved from `AuthContext` — and cleared at `recording-stopped` **and** `recording-stop-complete`, because the ordinary stop path emits the first and only the tray emits the second), ordered by **audio time** as defence in depth (the producer runs a single serial worker today — `NUM_WORKERS = 1` — so emission is already chronological; the ordering costs one `partition_point` per segment and means raising that constant cannot silently corrupt the window); **every emission is a final segment** — the producer's `is_partial` means "chunk under 15 s" (`whisper_engine.rs:738`), is set on most live speech and is never followed by a replacing final, so it is carried as `Turn.short_chunk` and drops nothing; a re-emitted `sequence_id` replaces in place and fires no second cue; **channel attribution is `Channel::Unknown`** — the producer hardcodes `source: "Audio"`, so me/them cannot be derived until the pipeline carries it (an `audio/` change outside this epic, see H13); the rule "no cue from `microphone` turns" is implemented and tested against the future value; a deterministic cue detector (`copilot::cue`: TR + EN interrogatives, the Turkish question particle in all its conjugations, English inversion, punctuation, request phrases; biased toward silence, threshold 0.40; a question split across a VAD boundary is joined with its predecessor, and a segment already offered as evidence is never re-cited) emits `copilot-cue` events carrying kind, confidence, the `sequence_id`s of the evidence and `workspace_id` — **no text**, the consumer resolves the ids against the transcript it already has; no LLM call, no I/O, no persistence, no transcript text in logs or in the counts-only `liveContext` status; tenant-scoped through `AuthContext` captured at session start; with the flag off nothing subscribes (`session::should_subscribe` is the one decision, and `apply_config` cannot reach `listen` without it).
- Verification: 88 Rust unit tests under `copilot::` (43 new in I2): TR/EN cues including the idiom exceptions ("ne yazık ki", "ne güzel") and the `müdür` noun; replacement-not-duplication; audio order under out-of-order workers; window eviction by time; continuation joining and its double-fire guard; no cue from `microphone`; zero subscriptions with the flag off; a closed, content-free status shape and a closed, content-free cue event; the session boundary re-resolves identity (a stale context from another workspace is replaced on `recording-started`). Three invariants mutation-checked before commit — the microphone gate removed, `should_subscribe` forced true, and the double-fire guard removed each fail exactly their own test. Also fixed here: the I1 panel dropped `is_partial` segments, i.e. most of the meeting (`CopilotPanel.tsx`); its test was flipped and mutation-checked.

### I4a · Modes registry v1 (minimal; parallel with I2) — ✅ BUILT 2026-09-13 (`feat/i4a-modes-registry`; PR pending)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: I0
- AC: new `modes/` generalises `summary/templates`: `Mode { id, name, purpose, user_role, counterpart_role, voice, summary_template_id, live: { allowed_actions, evidence_policy: SourceFirst | Open, cite_required }, allowed_sources }`; built-ins embedded — General, Client/Sales call, Team meeting, Recruiting interview (interviewer side), Lecture/Training, Consultation (legal/professional services — the strategy beachhead), Field/Site visit (industrial), Support call; custom modes as JSON or Markdown-with-front-matter files in the existing custom-templates directory, checked by a **pure** validator (preview before install, name collision, size cap — no I/O in the validator); **deliberately no candidate-side interview, exam or coding-solver mode**; existing summary generation keeps working unchanged through the template subset.
- Verification: 24 unit tests under `modes::`. Six rules mutation-checked — adding `Suggest` to the interview mode, swapping the interviewer and candidate roles, removing the rejected-category check, removing the transcript requirement, removing the size cap, and un-compiling a template each fail exactly their own test.
- **As built, with three deviations from the AC above, each for a reason found in the code:**
  1. **Custom modes are JSON only.** "Markdown-with-front-matter" is not implemented and deliberately not stubbed: front matter means a YAML parser, a new dependency whose licence CLAUDE.md §9 requires reviewing, for a format nobody has asked for. The cost of adding it later is one function — `validator::validate_mode` takes an already-parsed `Mode`, so a second format is a second *parser* beside `parse_mode_json` and touches no rule.
  2. **Three more summary templates are now compiled into the binary** (`project_sync`, `retrospective`, `sales_marketing_client_call`). They already shipped as files in `templates/`, but `get_template` could only reach them through the *bundled* directory, which `lib.rs` sets at startup from the app's resources — so they were unresolvable in `cargo test` and on any install whose resources did not land. Built-in modes point at `project_sync` and `sales_marketing_client_call`, and a mode must resolve with no runtime state, so all three were compiled in. `list_template_ids` de-duplicates and `get_template` still prefers a custom or bundled file, so nothing else changes.
  3. **`allowed_sources` may name a source that cannot be read yet.** `Knowledge` (I5) and `Screen` (I6) are declared so a mode written today still means the same thing later, and `AllowedSource::is_available_today` is the single place that says which can actually be retrieved — the ADR-0033 declared-but-unselectable pattern. I3 must build its prompt from `Mode::usable_sources()`, which today returns the transcript alone, rather than from `allowed_sources`.
- Also decided in the modes themselves, and tested: the recruiting-interview mode offers **no `Suggest` action** — "what should I say next" in an interview is a step toward putting words in the interviewer's mouth about a person being assessed — and the built-in `Spec` uses named fields rather than eleven positional strings, because swapping `user_role` and `counterpart_role` is exactly how the interviewer's mode would silently become the candidate's.
- Not included, and left to I4b: any Tauri command, service or Settings UI. This slice is the registry; nothing in the renderer can reach it yet.

### I3a · On-demand insights — the Rust pipeline (no UI) — ✅ BUILT 2026-09-13 (`feat/i3a-insight-pipeline`; PR #44)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /feature then /security-review · depends-on: I2, I4a
- AC: `copilot::insight` turns the I2 live window plus the I4a mode fragment into one grounded answer for one of the four actions. The prompt is built from `Mode::usable_sources()` (not `allowed_sources`), so a mode listing the knowledge base reads the transcript until I5 lands. **The window is redacted in `window_passages`, the only path from a `Turn` to prompt text** — the live context never went through SQLite, so this is the seam where C6's policy applies (ADR-0040). Citation ids come from `sequence_id` alone, so redaction cannot break source linking. The model is reached only through the existing `summary/` provider layer (BYOK); `CopilotConfig::allow_cloud_insights` defaults **off** and `generate_insight` refuses a provider it cannot show is local. Output is typed JSON; `ask::service::parse_claims` and `ask::grounding::ground_claims` are reused unchanged — an uncited or out-of-window citation is **dropped, never repaired**. Empty window ⇒ `LiveInsightOutcome::NoContext` with **no model call**. A 25 s timeout cancels the in-flight request (`AssembledProvider::call_cancellable`, new). Prompt capped at 40 turns keeping the recent end, reporting `turns_omitted`. Tenant mismatch between window and caller refuses. Nothing is persisted; only counts reach the log.
- Verification: 20 unit tests in `copilot::insight`, eight of them mutation-checked (no-redaction, tenant check, empty window, oldest-vs-newest, `allowed_sources`, action gate, cloud default, `CustomOpenAI`-as-local). `cargo test --lib` 653 pass; clippy unchanged at 119 (ADR-0017 baseline).
- Residual: `EvidencePolicy::Open` is not honoured — the one `Open` built-in is grounded strictly (ADR-0040). No live provider was exercised in the build session; that is I9's gate.

### I3b · On-demand insights — the panel UI — ✅ BUILT 2026-09-13 (`feat/i3b-insight-panel`; PR pending)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: I3a
- AC: `copilot_request_insight` / `copilot_cancel_insight` sit over `copilot::insight`; the live window is `prepare`d **synchronously under the context lock** and only then awaited (`session::with_context` takes a callback so a mutex guard cannot cross an `await`). One insight at a time: a second request cancels the first, matched by generation so a superseded answer cannot land in the card. The provider is the workspace's configured one — never silently downgraded to the local model to slip past the egress policy; a cloud provider with `allowCloudInsights` off is **refused and said so**. `copilot_get_status` now carries `liveActions`, so the panel renders only what the mode offers rather than letting Rust reject a click. `CopilotInsights` is purely presentational: Art. 50(1) disclosure on first open (dismissable, remembered, and shown **again** if storage throws), non-dismissable Art. 50(2) marking in every phase, and a distinct rendering for `noContext`, `refused` and each failure `kind` — never an empty card. An ungrounded claim's text never reaches the user, not even greyed out; dropped and omitted counts are stated rather than quietly shortening the answer.
- Verification: 23 Vitest cases in `CopilotInsights.test.tsx`, four mutation-checked — removing `<AiMarking/>` reddens 7 cases, rendering dropped claim text 1, defaulting the disclosure to acknowledged on a storage throw 1, and never disabling the buttons 2. `cargo test --lib` 653 pass; clippy unchanged at 119; tsc/lint clean; `pnpm vitest run` 230 pass; `/design/copilot` screenshot reviewed (four new frames: answered, working, nothing-to-answer-from, kept-on-the-device).
- **Not built: "Pin to notes" — split out as I3c (ADR-0041).** It cannot be written through the existing repository, and shipping it would destroy user-authored content on an unavoidable path. See I3c.

### I3c · Pin to notes (BLOCKED on a data-model decision — ADR-0041)
- Agent: db-migration-engineer + rust-tauri-core-engineer · Cmd: /db-migration then /feature · depends-on: I3b
- Why it is not in I3b, verified in the code: (1) there is **no `meetings` row** during a recording — the id is minted inside `TranscriptsRepository::save_transcript` (`transcript.rs:35`) when the user saves, and `upsert_draft` refuses without one (`summary_draft.rs:346`); (2) a pinned block's `source_chunk_id` must resolve to a live `transcripts` row (`ensure_sources_resolve`, `summary_draft.rs:215`), but the copilot's evidence ids are in-memory `t{sequence_id}` with no bridge; (3) `upsert_draft` binds `sections = ?` wholesale (`summary_draft.rs:397`) and `SummaryService` calls it with the model's output alone (`service.rs:1066`), so the ordinary post-meeting summary — and every regenerate — **erases every pinned block**, certainly rather than occasionally.
- AC: buffer pins in memory in `copilot::session` keyed by `sequence_id`; flush at save time once the meeting id and real transcript ids exist and the `t{seq}` → `transcripts.id` mapping resolves; add `SummariesRepository::append_block` over the existing private CAS writer (`write_sections_as_draft_if_current`) rather than a second `sections = ?` writer; and decide how `upsert_draft` preserves non-generated blocks — a `DraftBlock` provenance marker (`generated` | `pinned`) or an explicit merge. Status is still forced `draft` (the C1 rule).
- Blocking: the last point changes the `summaries.sections` JSON shape, so it needs its own ADR, a `docs/CONTRACTS.md` §4 update and a sync-compatibility note **before** any code.
- Verification: a test that runs a full generate-after-pin cycle and asserts the pinned block survives — the property whose absence is the whole reason this is deferred.

### I4b · Modes UI (panel selector + Settings editor) — ✅ BUILT 2026-09-14 (`feat/i4b-modes-ui`; PR pending)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature · depends-on: I4a, I3b
- AC: `modes::registry` (pure) decides which mode answers; `modes::store` persists the installed set in `modes.json` and **discards a blob stored for another workspace rather than migrating it** (MULTITENANCY rule 2). Six commands — `modes_list`, `modes_set_active`, `modes_preview`, `modes_install`, `modes_update`, `modes_remove` — each returning the whole view with the **resolved** active id, so the UI re-renders from the backend's answer. `copilot_get_status` now reports the active mode's actions, id and name, and `copilot_request_insight` builds its prompt from the active mode instead of the default: choosing a mode in Settings changes the panel's buttons and the prompt on the next poll. Panel shows an "Answering as <mode>" chip. Settings → Modes lists built-ins and custom modes, imports a file through the I4a preview (**nothing is written until the user has read what it would install**), edits a custom mode's name/purpose/voice, and removes one. Built-ins are read-only; the editor never exposes actions or sources — widening a permission is an install, not an edit (ADR-0042). No raw `invoke` in a component: everything goes through `services/modesService.ts`, and no validation is mirrored in TypeScript.
- Verification: 7 registry tests + 15 Vitest cases; six mutations applied and killed (panicking `resolve_active`, ignored workspace check, built-ins hidden from the taken list, built-ins made editable, import skipping the preview, unwired save guard — the last **survived the first attempt** and a test for the button/guard connection was added). `cargo test --lib` 660 pass; clippy unchanged at 119; tsc/lint clean; `pnpm vitest run` 247 pass; `/design/copilot` re-shot showing the mode chip.
- Not done: the Settings tab has no `/design` route — that would mean restructuring a container into a presentational component purely to produce a screenshot, and its interaction wiring is covered by tests (ADR-0042).

### I5 · Local knowledge base v1 (documents → grounded retrieval)
- Agent: db-migration-engineer + rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /db-migration then /feature then /tenant-check · depends-on: I0, B2
- AC: a forward-only, idempotent migration adds `knowledge_documents` (`id`, `workspace_id`, `title`, `source_kind` file|paste, `mime`, `sha256`, `byte_len`, `indexed_at`, common + sync columns) and `knowledge_chunks` (`id`, `workspace_id`, `document_id`, `position`, `text`, char range, common columns), plus the derived `knowledge_search_documents` routing map + `knowledge_search_fts` FTS5 index with maintenance triggers and secure-delete — the `transcript_search_*` precedent (ADR-0024/0026); ingestion for TXT/MD/PDF/DOCX with permissively licensed Rust crates only (no Python/Node sidecar; licences recorded in the third-party notices), with size caps; text lives only inside the SQLCipher database; `KnowledgeRepository::retrieve_knowledge_evidence(ctx, query, limit, mode_scope)` is tenant-scoped and every hit carries a `knowledge_chunk_id` that becomes a second `SourceRef` kind for Ask (Product Intelligence slice 3) and the copilot (I3 "Fact check" — checked **only** against the transcript and this knowledge base, never the web); citations render "from <document> · §/p."; deletion removes document, chunks and FTS rows under the ADR-0026 maintenance cycle; Settings → Knowledge (upload/paste, list, delete, index status, attach to modes); a negative cross-workspace test returns zero foreign hits; sync-compatibility note written (synced-class tables, local-only until D3; a Phase-2 admin-managed team knowledge base is additive).
- Verification: migration tests on empty + populated DB and ledger-idempotent re-run; repository tenant tests both directions; the SQLCipher conversion test's table list extended; ingestion tests per format.

### I6 · Screen context v1 (on-demand, previewed, redacted, not stored)
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /feature then /security-review · depends-on: I3
- AC: a hotkey/button captures **one** screenshot of a user-chosen monitor/window/region via `xcap` (Apache-2.0); never continuous, never timer-driven; a preview with crop and an explicit "send" confirm; text via OS-native OCR where available (Windows `Windows.Media.Ocr`, macOS Vision) behind the `inference/` capability seam, otherwise via a vision-capable configured provider **only after confirm**; OCR text passes `redaction::redact` before any prompt; the copilot panel itself is excluded from the capture (content protection or hidden during capture); nothing is written to disk or DB by default (memory only, zeroized after use); "attach as evidence" stores the OCR **text** (never the image) as a `Screen` SourceRef only when the user chooses; a workspace policy switch disables screen context entirely; on Linux Wayland (unsupported by `xcap`) the feature reports "unavailable" rather than failing.
- Verification: Rust tests for redaction-before-prompt and no-persistence; manual Windows + macOS check that the panel is absent from its own capture.

### I7 · Post-call parity — Recipes (deterministic), cross-meeting recall, manual speaker names
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer · Cmd: /feature (and /db-migration for the name map) · depends-on: C1, C3b, H6
- AC: **Recipes** are read-only transforms over **approved** summary blocks and approved action items only (follow-up email, internal update, client note, decision log, study notes) — deterministic templates first, copy/export only, no send; an LLM-polished variant is EPIC F (F2) territory and waits for C8; **cross-meeting recall** = deterministic overlap of this meeting's approved open questions/risks with recent meetings, shown as a projection (the ADR-0025 pattern; no LLM); **speaker naming** = a manual per-meeting rename map (storage decided by /db-migration) applied to `Speaker N` labels in the UI and exports, never suggested from voice (ADR-0034 ethics); all offline.
- Verification: unit tests for recipes and overlap; Vitest for rename propagation; export provenance still fails closed on unapproved content.

### I8 · Proactive suggestions (opt-in), usage ledger, local pre-call brief
- Agent: rust-tauri-core-engineer + frontend-nextjs-engineer + security-privacy-auditor · Cmd: /feature then /security-review · depends-on: I3 (proactive, ledger); G2 (brief — therefore post-C8)
- AC: proactive mode **default OFF**: the I2 deterministic prefilter plus a small "should I offer?" judge on the configured provider turns a cue into a quiet **offer chip** (never speaks, never acts), rate-limited, with per-mode thresholds; **usage ledger** table `usage_events` (`workspace_id`, `feature`, `provider`, `model`, `tokens_in`, `tokens_out`, `estimated_cost`, `ts`) — content-free, tenant-scoped, shown in Settings, never sent to analytics; **pre-call brief** is LOCAL only — the upcoming event from G2 calendar metadata (opt-in) + prior meetings with the same attendees + their open approved action items; no web research or profiling of third parties.
- Verification: judge prefilter/rate-limit tests; ledger content-free test (no meeting text can be inserted); brief renders from fixtures with G2 absent → "no calendar connected".

### I9 · Copilot enablement gate ⛔ GATE
- Agent: qa-release-engineer + security-privacy-auditor + multitenancy-guardian · Cmd: /security-review then /tenant-check · depends-on: I1–I7, **A5**
- AC: network-OFF smoke of every action with the built-in model; the §4 audio smoke (record → transcript on macOS and Windows) unchanged, with a diff proving no `audio/` file changed in the epic; a live smoke on ≥3 real, consented meetings (TR + EN) recording final-segment→first-token latency and citation validity (every citation resolves to an active same-workspace segment or knowledge chunk); Art. 50(1) + (2) disclosures verified by test; `/security-review` (prompt injection: transcript, screen and knowledge are untrusted input; no tool execution) and multitenancy-guardian PASS; per-platform screen-share behaviour documented with screenshots. Only then may `liveCopilot` default ON and any "live help" wording appear — and no latency figure is published without this measurement.

**Later, inside EPIC D (additive):** admin-managed team knowledge base and shared modes (the "Customization Suite" analogue), tenant-scoped content-free usage analytics, RBAC "only admins edit the knowledge base" — no schema change needed because `knowledge_documents` carries `workspace_id` and the sync columns from day one.

---

## Cross-cutting (apply on every task)
- Run the PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks (auto). Before any release: `/security-review` + `/tenant-check`.
- Add/adjust tests (server endpoints + non-trivial Rust logic). CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml) must be green.
- Update the relevant docs/ file and add an ADR when architecture/schema changes.
